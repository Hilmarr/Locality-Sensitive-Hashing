create sorted list of distances to the hyperplane

Step 1.
Remove distances higher than threshold, need to check on the other side of those hyperplanes

Step 2.
Start with list from step one
Remove distances that can't be combined with smallest distance and still be less than threshold
Check combinations:
	try to match pnt 1 with all
	try to match pnt 2 with all that matched with 1 (not the last couple if they did not match)
	try to match pnt 3 with all that matched with 2
	...

Step 3.
Start with list from step 2
Remove points that can not be matched with both pnt1 and pnt2
Check combinations:
	try to match pnt1, pnt2 with all
	try to match pnt1, pnt3 with all that matched with pnt1, pnt2
	...


-------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.
pnt1 < T?, pnt2 < T ?, ..., pntN < T

Step 2.
Check if points 2 to N are less than T - pnt1
Check if points 3 to N are less than T - pnt2 
Check if points 4 to N are less than T - pnt3
...

Step 3. 
Do step2 for T = T - pnt1, and list from 2 to N
Do step2 for T = T - pnt2, and list from 3 to N
Do step2 for T = T - pnt3, and list from 4 to N

Step 4. 
Do step3 for T = T - pnt1, and list from 2 to N
Do step3 for T = T - pnt2, and list from 3 to N
Do step3 for T = T - pnt3, and list from 4 to N


Can save distance and results from previous iterations perhaps.
Can also shorten search since if number a can't match with larger number c, then neither can number between them c.

Combine the two approaches listed here


-------------------
Or perhaps, alternatively

Try to see if all points less than threshold together are less than threshold
Then check recursively for each subset of one less
Then check recursively for each subset of two less
etc etc

This is probably more time consuming

Probably does not neet to be sorted actually, this should do just as well:	


findNeighbors(sqrdDists, threshold, nPlanes, indexCombinations, indexCombinationsDists)
	indexCombinations = {};
	indexCombinationsDists = {};
	
	setLen = 0
	for i = 1:nPlanes
		if (sqrdDists(i) < threshold)
			setLen = setLen + 1;
			indexCombinations.add({i});
			indexCombinationsDists.add(sqrdDists(i));
		end
	end

	for k = (nPlanes-1):-1:1
		for i = k:setLen
			if (sqrdDists(i) < threshold)
				dist = idxCombDists[j] + sqrdDists[i];
				if (dist < threshold)
					idxCombsDists.add(dist)
					idxCombs.add(setplus(i + idxComb[j]));
					setLen++;
				else
			end
		end
	end
end


Example runs:


Threshold = 6
Starting set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}

element < 6 ?
{1,2,3,4}

3 + 4 < 6 ? NO

2 + 3 < 6 ? YES
2 + 3 < 6 ? NO
{1, 2, 3, 4, (2,3)}

1 + 2 < 6 ? YES
1 + 3 < 6 ? YES
1 + 4 < 6 ? YES
1 + (2 + 3) < 6 ? NO
{1, 2, 3, 4, (2,3), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)}



Threshold = 6
Starting set = {3, 1, 4, 8, 2}

element < 6 ?
{3, 1, 4, 2}

4 + 2 < 6 ? NO

1 + 4 < 6 ? YES
1 + 2 < 6 ? YES
{3, 1, 4, 2, (1,4), (1,2)}

3 + 1 < 6 ? YES
3 + 4 < 6 ? NO
3 + 2 < 6 ? YES
3 + (1 + 4) < 6 ? NO
3 + (1 + 2) < 6 ? NO
{3, 1, 4, 2, (1,4), (1,2), (3,1), (3,2)}



actually, we need masks that we can later use to xor with the hashcode

findNeighborMasks(sqrdDists, threshold, nPlanes, indexCombinationMasks, indexCombinationDists)
	indexCombinationMasks = {};
	indexCombinationDists = {};
	
	setLen = 0
	for i = 1:nPlanes
		if (sqrdDists(i) < threshold)
			setLen++;
			indexCombinationMasks.add(1 << (i-1));
			indexCombinationDists.add(sqrdDists(i));
		end
	end

	for k = (nPlanes-1):-1:1
		for i = k:setLen
			if (sqrdDists(i) < threshold)
				dist = idxCombDists[j] + sqrdDists[i];
				if (dist < threshold)
					setLen++;
					idxCombsDists.add(dist)
					idxCombs.add(xor(1 << (i-1), idxComb[j]));
				else
			end
		end
	end

	return setLen; // and also implicitly indexCombinationMasks and indexCombinationDists
end


[setLen, indexCombinationMasks, indexCombinationDists]Â = findNeighborMasks(sqrdDists, threshold, nPlanes)
	indexCombinationMasks = {};
	indexCombinationDists = {};
	
	setLen = 0
	for i = 1:nPlanes
		if (sqrdDists(i) < threshold)
			setLen++;
			indexCombinationMasks.add(1 << (i-1));
			indexCombinationDists.add(sqrdDists(i));
		end
	end

	setLenOld = setLen;
	for k = (setLenOld-1):-1:1
		tmp = setLen;
		for i = (k+1):setLen
			if (idxCombDists[k] < threshold)
				dist = idxCombDists[k] + sqrdDists[i];
				if (dist < threshold)
					tmp++;
					idxCombsDists.add(dist)
					idxCombs.add(or(1 << (i-1), idxComb[j]));
				else
			end
		end
		setLen = tmp;
	end

	return [setLen, indexCombinationMasks, indexCombinationDists]
end
