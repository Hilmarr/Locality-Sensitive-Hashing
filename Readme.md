# Locality_Sensitive_Hashing

A few implementations of Locality Sensitive Hashing

Most of the actual interesting stuff has been moved or copied to the "SUMMARY" folder.

In the summary folder there are:

* some programs for creating orthogonal hyperplanes with elements that sum to zero, sometimes made to fit some input points.

* a folder with two fully implemented versions of LSH, one using several tables in order to increase accuracy, the other checking boxes within a thresholded distances. Both are optimized using OpenACC.

* some matlab prototypes which are probably easier to read, though may also contain more errors.

The two pdf's are my master's thesis and the slides for my master's presentation respectively.

The files for the example SIFT feature descriptors are not included in the repo to save space.
